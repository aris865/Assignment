## How to use

### I'm using *pipenv* for environment and requirements management.
### If you have *pipenv* installed in your system do the following:

- Clone the repo
- Inside the repo's folder run `pipenv install`. This way **requirements** will be installed automatically.
- Run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.
- Run `python producer.py` to start the producer process.
- Run `python consumer.py` to start the consumer process.

### Alternatively:

- Create a python virtual environment (optional).
- Clone the repo.
- Install the requirements (Using pip).
- Activate the environment (if you are using one).
- Run `python producer.py` to start the producer process.
- Run `python consumer.py` to start the consumer process.
